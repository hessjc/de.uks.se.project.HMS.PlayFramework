PlaySimpleAuthentication Plugin
==========================================

1. General

This plugin is an extension for the "Play Authenticate" plugin which facilitates the use of "local" username/password verification.

2. Usage

To use this plugin, follow these steps:

2.1 Add the plugin to your project dependencies in "Build.scala", e.g.:

	val appDependencies = Seq(
		...
		
		"de.uks.se" %% "play-simple-authentication" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
	)
	
2.2 Add the following configuration files:

	* ${yourProject}/conf/playauthenticate.conf
	
		This file configures the "Play Authenticate" part, e.g. some mail configuration must be done here.
	
	* ${yourProject}/conf/simpleauth.conf
	
		This file configures the "PlaySimpleAuthentication" part. You have to specify your implementations of 
		"util.CallAuthFactory" and "util.UserFactory".
	
	* ${yourProject}/conf/smtp.conf
	
		This file configurs the "Play Easymail" part. Here you define all mailing settings.
		
	Examples configurations can be found in "resources/conf" of the PlaySimpleAuthentication plugin.
	
2.3 Implement the required interfaces "util.CallAuthFactory" and "util.UserFactory". PlaySimpleAuthentication uses these interfaces during the different
	phases "signup" and "login". 
	
	Don't forget to specify your implementations in "${yourProject}/conf/simpleauth.conf" as described in 2.2.
	
2.4 Create your views for "Signup" and "Login". You can use the built-in 
		
		"provider.SimpleUserPassAuthProvider.SimpleAuthSignup" and 
		"provider.SimpleUserPassAuthProvider.SimpleLogin"
		
	as data objects for your forms.
	
2.5 Create your controllers.

	Your controller should at least handle the following three cases:
	
	a) Signup an user. The controller is expected to call "UsernamePasswordAuthProvider.handleSignup(ctx())" after validating the signup form.
	b) Login an user. The controller is expected to call "UsernamePasswordAuthProvider.handleLogin(ctx())" after validating the login form.
	c) Logout an user. The controller is expected to call "PlayAuthenticate.logout(session())" after validating the login form.
